Allows you to upload a SoundSlides presentation, and generates embed code to display it in your site.

== Description ==

**PLEASE NOTE**: This plugin requires that your version of PHP be compiled with ZIP support!

Updated: I tried to clarify the instructions a bit. I haven't had time to update this in a long while, but I would be willing to put work into it if anyone wanted to make a small donation :-). Contact me if you're interested.

Updated: Admin page should validate by W3C standards now.

This plugin allows you to upload a SoundSlides presentation, and it generates embed code for displaying it in your site. Using the plugin requires that you create a ZIP file of the *contents* of your `publish_to_web folder`; don't zip the folder itself. You'll then upload that zip, and be given both full embed code, and a short form you can use for inserting the slideshow. I'd recommend using the full embed code; the editor that comes with WordPress strips out the short tag if you switch between source and visual views.

The code for the plugin isn't as pretty as it could be; if it turns out to be popular, I'll clean it up. The plugin outputs HTML, not XHTML. I'm a firm believer in not using XHTML for general purpose Web sites.
